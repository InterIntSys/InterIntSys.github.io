Konstantin Lackner is a researcher in artificial intelligence (direct quote: "*I hate that term*") at the Paris Lodron
University Salzburg. His research interests encompass the societal impact of AI as well as popular algorithmic
systems, particularly in social media, and the potential detection of AI-generated content. In his doctoral studies,
he is set out to deconstruct the numerous misconceptions surrounding artificial intelligence (and especially "explainable
AI"), chart a course for its future use and perception, and educate the public on the underlying principles of these
systems.

During his Masterâ€™s studies, he contributed to two research projects investigating the impact of systems like ChatGPT on
higher education, which he subsequently summarised in his thesis.

As a side project, he enjoys designing and playing games.

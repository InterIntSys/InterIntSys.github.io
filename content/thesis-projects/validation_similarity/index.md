## Idea
Similarity and diversity are essential ingredients of recommender systems. Based on such metrics, similar items may be recommended to users ("more of the same"). Or a portfolio might be diversified to prevent having an overly similar set of items.   
Research has come up with a wide portfolio of similarity and diversity metrics that are used in so-called offline studies (purely computational). The goal of this project to validate existing metrics in a user study.

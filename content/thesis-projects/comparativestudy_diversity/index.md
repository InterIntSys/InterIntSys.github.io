## Idea
Similarity and diversity are essential for recommender systems, as they help predict items a user may like. Research has come up with a broad portfolio of similarity and diversity metrics. The core of this project is to perform a comparative analysis of such metrics. The idea is to run computational experiments (offline study) and analyze how congruent (or different) the indications for similarity or diversity are for a set of metrics.

        What about doing a [Systematic Literature Review, according to Kitchenham](https://www.elsevier.com/__data/promis_misc/525444systematicreviewsguide.pdf)?
        With such an approach, you would have to deal systematically with literature---and keep it well organized. It requires finding literature, documenting the process, labeling publications according to a prepared set of criteria, extracting some content from the papers (again in a labeled way), and probably aggregating labels to have a coherent picture. Then you could "quantify" the labels Ã  la: X\% of papers deal with subtopic A, Y\% deal with subtopic B, Z\% deal with both topics, etc. To get an impression of what such work looks like, here are examples of systematic literature reviews that we have done:<br><br>

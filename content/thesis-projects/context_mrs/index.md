## Idea
This topic should give an overview on what context elements are considered in research on music recommenders (as ingredient to the algorithms). Recommender systems that use context information other than the combination of item and user, are referred to as context-aware recommender systems. Yet, note, in the papers themselves, the authors do not necessarily call those context-aware. The goal is to identify research gaps (e.g., demographics and time are frequently researched on, while country information or location are rarely used, etc.).

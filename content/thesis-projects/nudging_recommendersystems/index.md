## Idea
Recommender systems help to filter the tremendous amount of content available. The user can then choose from the filtered content, typically presented as an ordered list.
How and where---and if at all---content is presented may influence a user's decision on what to select. It may even drive the user to abandon the offer and potentially switch to a competitor.
Nudging is a strategy to subtly guide a user in the selection process.
How can nudging be integrated into recommender systems? What is already widely integrated, and what strategies have not yet been leveraged in typical recommender systems?

## Idea
Many systems and applications are called "intelligent" or "smart". Other systems and applications are not.
The expert's definition of intelligent or smart systems or applications does not always match the common public's understanding.
This project aims to investigate which system characteristics make consumers perceive a system or application as "intelligent".

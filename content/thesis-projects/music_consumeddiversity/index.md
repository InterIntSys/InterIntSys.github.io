## Idea
Music recommender systems are integral to popular music platforms, such as Spotify, Pandora, and YouTube. Recommender systems help to filter the tremendous amount of content available, and - with it - they also influence to a certain degree what kind of content users consume.
The central question of this project is: How do music recommender systems influence the diversity of the music items consumed?
Subquestions that have to be dealt with:
- What is considered "diverse" in the context of music recommendations?
- Does the diversity of items consumed change over time? How?
- Is there a difference in the diversity across different types/segments of users?

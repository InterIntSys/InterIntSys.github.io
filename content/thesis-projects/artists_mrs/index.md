## Idea
Music recommender systems are used in streaming services (e.g., Spotify, YouTube); they recommend music to users based on their musical taste, listening activity, or mood. Some examples of recommender systems are automatic playlist generation (e.g., Spotify's personalized 'Discover Weekly' or unpersonalized 'Popular Music from the 90s'), suggestions to add tracks to an existing playlist, or artists suggested based on your previous listening behavior.
This project aims to identify potential problems that affect artists and draw on your ideas about how you would like future recommender systems to work.

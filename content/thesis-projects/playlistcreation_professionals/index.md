## Idea
Many music professionals create their playlists (e.g., on music streaming platforms such as Spotify or Pandora or in their music software) for various professional purposes---e.g., for teaching music students, learning to play/sing new songs, creating playlists for events, etc.   
The guiding research question is: What do professional musicians or music students consider when creating/organizing a playlist?   
The goal of the project is to find out what aspects are important when creating and organizing a playlist - important from the music professionals' perspective.
Ultimately, these findings can be used to develop playlist recommenders or music continuation approaches (e.g., when you start with one or several music items and then the playlist is automatically continued) that consider those aspects.
The results might differ significantly from what a typical consumer may consider important.

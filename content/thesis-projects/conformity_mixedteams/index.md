## Idea
Conformity is a concept from social psychology and was coined by Asch. It refers to the phenomenon that individuals tend to forgo their personal strategy (e.g., opinion, preference) and adopt the conflicting majority opinion, preference, strategy, etc.
Only a few studies have investigated people's conformity behavior in mixed groups of human and nonhuman agents. Early research suggests different levels of conformity depending on the specific group composition and the task type.
The goal of this project is to investigate this phenomenon in more detail.

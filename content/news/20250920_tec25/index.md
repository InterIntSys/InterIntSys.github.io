participated in a dynamic and thought-provoking panel discussion alongside an impressive group of panelists: 
Irina Nalis, Yufang Hou, Teki Akuetteh, and Virginia Dignum, moderated by Elka Xharo.

This panel was a rare and inspiring example of female-dominated representation. While not diverse in terms of gender, the panel brought together experts from a wide range of fields, offering diverse perspectives on the topic. Despite their varied viewpoints, the panelists unanimously agreed on two key points:
The issue of inequality in artificial intelligence is of critical importance to society.
Addressing this challenge is complex, but they are ready to tackle it—with the active contribution of everyone, regardless of gender.

The workshop was honored by the presence of [Federal Minister Eva-Maria Holzleitner](https://www.bmfwf.gv.at/ministerium/bundesministerin-eva-maria-holzleitner.html), who delivered an inspiring welcome address.

This workshop highlighted the pressing need for interdisciplinary collaboration to address the societal challenges posed by artificial intelligence and its potential to reinforce inequality.

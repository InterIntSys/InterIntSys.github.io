We are exited that {{% mention "valdy-wiratama" %}} 
has been accepted to the [Doctoral School PLUS (DSP) 'Organization Studies'](https://www.plus.ac.at/doctorate-school-plus-en/doctorate-school-plus/research-groups-of-doctorate-school-plus-en/doctoral-school-for-organization-studies/?lang=en). He now joins a group of doctoral researchers and supervisors from the fields of business, psychology, and communication studies---and expands it to include the field of human-computer interaction.

The DSP 'Organization Studies' is coordinated by [Christine Vallaster](https://www.plus.ac.at/business/marketing/team-neu/univ-prof-dr-christine-vallaster/?lang=en) and [Simon Oertel](https://www.plus.ac.at/business/smo/team/oertel/?lang=en). Building bridges between disciplines across faculty boundaries is a central guiding principle of EXDIGIT---{{% mention "valdy-wiratama" %}} 
and {{% mention "christine-bauer" %}} 
demonstrate how enriching this diversity of perspectives is for research and discourse.

Valdy conducts research on fairness in recommender systems, with a particular focus on how such systems can be audited. His dissertation, provisionally titled 2Towards a Stakeholder-Centered Auditing Framework for Assessing Fairness in AI-Based Recommender Systems: The Case of Music Streaming", positions fairness as an organizational and inter-organizational challenge that considerably highlights the perspectives and interests of stakeholders. Accordingly, this research engages with topics such as AI, recommender systems, fairness, stakeholders, and auditing.

We congratulate Valdy on his acceptance to the DSP and wish him great success with his research. We look forward to learning about his future research findings.

As the year comes to a close, we are proud of what our group accomplished---engaging discussions, productive collaborations, new research, and enriching engagement with the public. We are grateful to our colleagues across institutions, supporters, and everyone who took an interest in our work for their support, trust, and encouragement.

Toward the end of the year, we are taking time to slow down and recharge. We hope everyone can find a moment to rest and reflect. Thank you for being part of our journey---your feedback, questions, and collaboration make our work stronger. 

We are looking forward to the new year with fresh ideas, updates on ongoing projects, and new opportunities to connect. Until then, wishing you a calm and relaxing end of the year.

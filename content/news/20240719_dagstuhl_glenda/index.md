[Glenda Hannibal](/author/glenda-hannibal) participated in the [Dagstuhl seminar (24292) on the topic "Improving Trust Between Humans and Software Robots in Robot Process Automation (RPA)"](https://www.dagstuhl.de/24292).
The overall goal of the seminar was "to explore the scientific and technological foundations to pioneer new trust-aware RPA solutions that work in partnership with the human workforce, to enhance human capabilities rather than replace human intelligence and break through the barriers to human trust using RPA".
She contributed to this seminar with a lightning talk with the title "The Moral Dimension of Trust", highlighting the topic-related discussions in the philosophy of trust and emphasizing the important relation between trust and vulnerability. 

Glenda came back with a lot of insights from this vibrant seminar.

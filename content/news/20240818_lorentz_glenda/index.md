{{% mention "glenda-hannibal" %}} 
participated in the [Lorentz workshop on the topic "Research Environments for Human-Machine Teaming"](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/research-environments-for-human-machine-teaming.html) at the Lorentz Center in Leiden, The Netherlands, from 12-16 August 2024.

It is common to study human-machine teaming in simulated and/or controlled environments. However, it is challenging to design realistic and reusable human-machine collaboration studies in these environments. The workshop brought together people from various disciplines who face the same challenges, to discuss and identify reusable solutions and methods that can help overcome these challenges.
